# GENERATIVE-TEXT-MODEL

**COMPANY**: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS  
**NAME**: NISHRITHA VEMULA  
**INTERN ID**: CODF274  
**DOMAIN**: NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (TEXT GENERATION)  
**DURATION**: 4 WEEKS  
**MENTOR**: NEELA SANTOSH

**DESCRIPTION**  
This project implements a Text Generation model using Hugging Face Transformers and Flask. It allows users to generate meaningful and coherent text outputs from user-defined prompts. The model uses GPT-2 in different sizes (gpt2, gpt2-medium, gpt2-large, gpt2-xl), enabling a range of generation quality and speed. The user interface is built using HTML and CSS, providing a smooth experience for entering prompts, selecting models, tuning generation parameters, and viewing the output. The generation process is controlled using configurable parameters like max length, temperature, top-k, and top-p for diverse and natural outputs.

**FEATURES**  
The application supports multiple pre-trained GPT-2 models. Users can choose their preferred model using a dropdown menu based on the desired speed and quality. It allows customization of text generation with parameters like temperature, top-k, top-p, and max length. The generated output is displayed instantly, and the original prompt remains on the page for reference. The app also shows how long the generation process took and provides clear output formatting.

**INSTALLATION**  
Clone the repository using:  
`git clone https://github.com/Nishritha-vemula/GENERATIVE-TEXT-MODEL.git`  
Then navigate to the project directory:  
`cd GENERATIVE-TEXT-MODEL`  

Install all the required dependencies using:  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

---

**USAGE**  
To run the application, use the command:  
`python app.py`  

After running, open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. Enter your text prompt, select the desired GPT-2 model, adjust generation settings if needed, and click “Generate Text” to get your result.

**EXAMPLE*  
*Prompt:* What are the uses of machine learning in healthcare?  
*Output (gpt2-large):*  
Machine learning in healthcare is used for disease diagnosis, personalized treatment, drug discovery, and patient data analysis. Algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks help predict outcomes and improve decision-making.

**FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS**  
The project can be enhanced by adding support for larger or more advanced models like GPT-3. Features such as text summarization and paraphrasing can be added. Real-time output with better UI feedback, cloud deployment, and options to download the results are also planned for future updates.
